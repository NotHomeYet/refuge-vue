# refuge-vue
A simple social / information sharing app designed for the Refuge - the youth group of Foundry Church
Originally written in angular / ionic, ported to vue / ionic

**DEV NOTE**
In order to compile you will need to add a src/store/modules/config.js file that contains the needed firebase config info / messaging API key.
A sample file has been included, simply copy the file, rename to config.js, and use the correct firebase config info.
